<h2>Languages ​​of the Software Used</h2>

<h2>What is our purpose?</h2>

<p>Nowadays, the security of our personal accounts depends on people's awareness.</p>

<p>That's why in this project we showed how easy it is for personal accounts to be compromised by hackers.</p>

<h2>So, how can we protect ourselves from this?</h2>

<p>First, make sure that the social network links you are logged into are correct.</p>

<p>Secondly, don't trust anyone. Nowadays, anyone can write these codes and therefore you must be conscious.</p>

<p>It's that simple.</p>
